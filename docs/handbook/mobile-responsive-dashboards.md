## How to design Mobile responsive Dashboards?

### 1. Making a Separate Dashboard only for Mobile devices

One way to optimize dashboards for mobile screens is to have a separate dashboard for each particular device. Additionally, you should consider having a lesser number of columns in the database tables while designing mobile responsive dashboards. Databases like MySQL have no limit on the number of tables. While there’s nothing unusual about having hundreds of tables in a database, It’s essential to filter out unnecessary database tables before moving to optimize them for mobile screens. A good way to start is by asking yourself - Is this table/schema really necessary?

## Charts

Charts helps our users get a clearer picture of large amounts of data and how they compare with other data. These Charts convey information quickly and easily to the user. A Metabase dashboard contains a set of Charts and Data tables brought together which you can share with your team.

Metabase provides us with following kinds of Charts:

### Line Chart

A Line chart, also known as a line graph, is a type of chart used to visualize the value of something over time. It is a graphical representation which connects a series of data points with a continous line.

>For example, Here's a line chart which displays total ratings a product has recieved over a period of time

### Area Chart

Area chart is a graph that combines a line chart and a bar chart to show changes in quantities over time. It's similar to a line graph in that data points are plotted and connected by line segments.

>The following chart shows the same ratings data as above but with an Area chart

### Bar Chart

A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent.

Although the Metabase graphs can be plotted vertically (bars standing up) or horizontally (bars laying flat from left to right), the most usual type of bar graph is vertical.

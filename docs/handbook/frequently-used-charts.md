## Frequently Used Charts

Charts helps our users get a clearer picture of large amounts of data and how they compare with other data. These Charts convey information quickly and easily to the user. A Metabase dashboard contains a set of Charts and Data tables brought together which you can share with your team.

Metabase provides us with following kinds of Charts:

### Line Chart

A Line chart, also known as a line graph, is a type of chart used to visualize the value of something over time. It is a graphical representation which connects a series of data points with a continous line.

>For example, Here's a line chart which displays total ratings a product has recieved over a period of time

### Area Chart

Area chart is a graph that combines a line chart and a bar chart to show changes in quantities over time. It's similar to a line graph in that data points are plotted and connected by line segments.

>The following chart shows the same ratings data as above but with an Area chart

### Bar Chart

A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent.

Although the Metabase graphs can be plotted vertically (bars standing up) or horizontally (bars laying flat from left to right), the most usual type of bar graph is vertical.

### Row Chart

A row chart is a variation on a bar chart, where data is visualized with horizontal bars rather than vertical.

>Here is a row chart which displays data w.r.t price and rating of a product

### Waterfall Chart

A waterfall chart shows a running total as values are added or subtracted. It's useful for understanding how an initial value (for example, net income) is affected by a series of positive and negative values.

The Metabase columns are color coded so you can quickly tell positive from negative numbers.

### Bubble Chart

A bubble chart is commonly used to visualize relationships between three or more numeric variables. Each bubble in a chart represents a single data point.

Bubble chart is a data visualization method that displays multiple circles in a two-dimensional plot. It is a very similar to the scatter chart, except data points are replaced with bubbles.

>Following bubble chart shows data which takes in consideration the price and rating of a product
